## Data

We’ll be analyzing the `biopsy` dataset, which comes originally from the MASS package. It is a breast cancer dataset from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. He assessed biopsies of breast tumors for 699 patients; each of nine attributes was scored on a scale of 1 to 10. The true outcome (benign/malignant) is also known.

The data is available there: <https://wilkelab.org/classes/SDS348/data_sets/biopsy.csv>
